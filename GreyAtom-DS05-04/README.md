### Project Overview

 This part of the project covers examples of datadrames manipulation using Pandas; another popular Python library among Data Science community.


### Learnings from the project

 I honed by data wranggling skills by solving this exercise.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I am already familiar with pandas functionality and syntax, which I applied to the given problem as per directions.


### Challenges faced

 I occasionally referred the Pandas documentation for clarity.


### Additional pointers

 Data wranggling is fairly simple and often first step in the model building process. Pandas is the go to library for such tasks. Pandas can read the flat files, SQL datasets, JSON etc. However, for big data, one may use other libraries _viz_., Koalas, SparkML etc., which are now based on same dataframe concept as with Pandas.
