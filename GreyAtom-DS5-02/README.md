### Project Overview

 This project is a part of five day data science workhsop by Grey Atom. This module is continuation of python 101 code snippets, which tests condidate's command on python syntax.


### Learnings from the project

 Practicing basic python syntax


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I executed the code on the fly. No external material was referred to.


### Challenges faced

 As I mentioned in the previous post, these are fairly straightforward exercises - meant to warm up for the real thing!


### Additional pointers

 Should test candidate on OOP concepts - that's worth publishing on GitHub.
