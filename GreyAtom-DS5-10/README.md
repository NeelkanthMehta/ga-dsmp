### Project Overview

 Google Play Store serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications. Success of an app is largely determined by its ratings.

But is there any particular pattern among high rated apps? Does size or genre of the app play a role in determining its high rating?

Let's find out.

**Problem Statement**
Conduct an EDA on the Google Play Store data and try to explore whether given the data, ratings of an can be predicted.

**About the Dataset**

The following is a snapshot of the dataset:

### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of certain methods of EDA and Data Preprocessing. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

1. Removing Missing Values
2. Cleaning Data
3. Exploring Data through various plots


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 We followed following procedure:
1. Explored the distribution of the variables
2. Identified and treated NULL values.
3. Visualized the distribution of ratings _vis-a-vis_ each category (through box-plots)
4. We also tried to identify whether there is a strong association between installs and ratings.
5. for price vs ratings
6. genre vs ratings
7. And for last update time vs ratings
