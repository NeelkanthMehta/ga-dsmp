### Project Overview

 This project involvs predicting prices of new Lego product before its price is revealed. The dataset contains information on Lego sets scrapped from lego.com; wherein each observation contains information on various features _viz_., ages, number of reviews, pieces count, play star rating, star rating, theme name and so on. We build a linear regression model to predict 


### Learnings from the project

 Attempting this project offers better understanding on implementing a supervised learning regression model. The following topics are covered:

1. Train-test split
2. Correlation between the features
3. Linear Regression
4. MSE and R^2 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 For implementing a supervised Learning model, following steps need to be carried out:
1. Load data (in this case, from a flat file);
2. Explore and clean, i.e., examine the structre of the dataset and its variables, drop or impute missing values, transform variables and so on...
3. Only once everything else is in place, a model is fitted to train set.
4. The model is then used to preduct the output of test set.
5. Finally, the preformance of a (regression) model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squarred error and coefficient of determination.


### Challenges faced

 Again, this is faily straight-forward model, which involved little cleaning and transformation.


### Additional pointers

 Would look forward to explore the classification model (Logistic regression) covered next.
