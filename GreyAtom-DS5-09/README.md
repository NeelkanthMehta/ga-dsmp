### Project Overview

 This mini project is part of Module 5 of Sprint 2 (Foundations of ML) of Data Science Masters program of GreyAtom. 

In this project, we are given Melbourne Housing dataset, which consists of >6K observations and ~15 features including "Rooms", "Type", "Method", "SellerG", "Distance", "Postcode", "Bathroom", "Car", "Landsize", "BuildingArea", "YearBuilt", "CouncilArea", "Longtitude", "Regionname", "PropertyCount" that could be used to predict "Price" of the house.


### Learnings from the project

 The data is curated to hone skills in regularization and model selection methodologies _viz_., Polynomial Feature creation, Lasso, Ridge, Cross Validation and GridSearchCV and evaluation metrics of R2 score and Root Mean Square Error.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used ScikitLearn library to solve the problem. In perticular I created Pipeline and instantiated preprocessing steps of polynomial feature creation and a model. For cross validation and hyper-parameter tuning, split train and test set and then further divided train set into validation set, on which the GridSearchCV was fit. 


### Challenges faced

 Not that I can think of.
