### Project Overview

     This series of code snippets contain data wrangling using NumPy library


### Learnings from the project

 Honed in using Numpy library


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Solving this problem statement requires one to be familiar with NumPy library, which is quite prevalent among data science community. I referred to NumPy documentation wherever required; but mostly the exercises went smoothly.


### Challenges faced

 Like I said, NumPy is the prominent library for mathematical/ numerical applications. It is vast and there's always to learn something new while using NumPy. I referred to its documentation page wherever I wanted to recal the syntax of any functions.


### Additional pointers

 Not that I can think of.
