### Project Overview

 This project is a part of five day data science workhsop by Grey Atom. This module comprises python 101 code snippets, which tests condidate's command on python syntax.


### Learnings from the project

 Nuances of Pythonic syntax, which otherwise we take for granted, _viz_., bitwise execution.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I executed the code on the fly. No external material was referred to.


### Challenges faced

 I can't think of any major challenges I faced for this is Python 101 module. I look forward for a more involved project.


### Additional pointers

 Should test candidate on OOP concepts - that's worth publishing on GitHub.
